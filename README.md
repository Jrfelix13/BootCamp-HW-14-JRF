# Mapping-earthquakes-with-GeoJson
Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet
In this project we use the information of the USGS(United States Geological Survey) to visualize the earthquakes data on a map. 
Showing not only the pinpoint of the earthquake, but also the magnitude, the date and time and the most close tectonic plates.
